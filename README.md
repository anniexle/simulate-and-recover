The simulate-and-recover process was conducted to evaluate whether the EZ Diffusion model can accurately estimate its three key parameters: boundary separation (α), drift rate (ν), and non-decision time (τ). The main goal of this process was to determine if bias (the difference between estimated and true values) approaches zero as sample size increases, and whether squared error (the variability in estimates) decreases, indicating more precise estimates.The results support the expected statistical behavior of a well-implemented model: as N increases, bias decreases, and squared errors become smaller. This trend demonstrates that the EZ Diffusion model is capable of recovering parameters with increasing accuracy as more data becomes available.

- Bias measures how far the recovered parameters deviate from the actual values. Ideally, if the model is working correctly, bias should approach zero as N increases.
   - N = 10 → Bias values are still noticeable, particularly for boundary separation (0.2178). This suggests that with small sample sizes, there is still some systematic error in parameter recovery.
   - N = 40 → Bias values drop significantly, with boundary separation bias at 0.0231 and drift rate bias at -0.0208. This indicates that increasing sample size helps the model stabilize.
   - N = 4000 → Bias values are practically zero (0.0005 for drift rate, 0.0006 for boundary separation), confirming that the model does not systematically overestimate or underestimate any parameters when given sufficient data.

Overall, the decreasing trend in bias means that the EZ Diffusion model is statistically unbiased when tested across large sample sizes.

- Squared error measures the precision of the estimates—how much they fluctuate from one trial to another. A good model should show lower squared errors as N increases, meaning the recovered parameters become more stable.
   - N = 10 → Squared errors are relatively high (0.4078 for drift rate, 0.2013 for boundary separation), indicating significant variability in estimates.
   - N = 40 → Squared errors drop considerably (0.1202 for drift rate, 0.0420 for boundary separation), meaning that as more data is introduced, estimates become more consistent.
   - N = 4000 → Squared errors approach zero (0.0012 for drift rate, 0.0001 for boundary separation), confirming that with large datasets, the model achieves high precision in parameter recovery.

This pattern follows standard statistical principles: smaller datasets introduce more noise, but as N increases, random fluctuations average out, leading to greater precision. The results confirm that the model’s estimates improve with increasing data, reinforcing its reliability in large-scale studies.

The results also highlight the importance of sample size in cognitive science research. If N is too small, estimates may be unreliable due to random variability, potentially leading to misleading conclusions. However, as more trials are conducted, the model’s estimates stabilize, making it a powerful tool for analyzing decision-making processes. Additionally, these findings validate the implementation of the EZ Diffusion model in this study. The use of correct forward equations, statistical sampling distributions, and inverse recovery methods ensured that the model functioned as expected. The decreasing bias and squared errors confirm that the implemented equations are mathematically sound and that the model can be used for accurate cognitive parameter estimation. The EZ Diffusion model successfully recovers cognitive parameters, with bias approaching zero and squared error decreasing as sample size increases. The findings confirm that the model is both statistically unbiased and increasingly precise with larger datasets. This makes it a valid and reliable tool for estimating decision-making parameters in cognitive modeling. The results reinforce a core principle of data analysis: good models get better with more data.
